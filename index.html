			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h3> By Gabriel Ellul</h3>
			
			<p>Everyone knows at least one out of the big four of Gothic literature. These books established many horror staples and tropes that we still see in modern media. Most people however disregard the original books as boring and old-timey, however if one gives them a chance and puts in the effort to understand these magnificent books one will find a treasure trove of mystery. Each book is an absolute page turner that should be given a chance.</p>
			<p> With this website I hope to introduce you to these books and the characters within them and hopefully convince you to give them a shot. </p>
			<h2>Each page includes: </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A short synopsis of the book</li>
				<li>Character art and quotes</li>
				<li>Adaptaions of the stories ranging from stage plays to comic books.</li>

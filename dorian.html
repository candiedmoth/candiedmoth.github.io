			<h1>The picture of Dorian Gray</h1>
			<h3> By Oscar Wilde </h3>
			<h2>Synopsis</h2>
			<p>The picture of Dorian Gray follows the titular man, Dorian Gray. Basil Hallward, enamoured by him, paints a portrait of Dorian. When he finds that the portrait starts aging in his place he grows self centred and adventurous. Vain and beautiful he’s easily corrupted into a life of debauchery, romance and crime.</p>

			<blockquote> Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. </blockquote>
			
			<h3>Lord Henry Wotton </h3>

			<blockquote> The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself... </blockquote>

			<blockquote> “Mother! mother!” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I love him. I love him because he is like what Love himself should be. But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet—why, I cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I feel proud, terribly proud.[”] </blockquote>
